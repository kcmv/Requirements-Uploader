Requirements Uploader
===

This project was built to automate the process of submitting the documents of an applicant/employee in a BPO setup company. The requirements are categorized in two types: First day requirements which includes government documents (SSS, BIR 2316 etc.) Second is the Other requirements (Personal documents like TOR, School or Company ID). The other features are vaccination/booster uploader and document request. The document request section enables the employee to request to any of document from the company like COE, BIR etc. The API can be consumed (REST API) by a third party HR system to validate entries and respond the status back to user with comments, send document requests to employee's email via automation process systems. Files/Documents are stored in Azure Storage using the Azure Storage API.
